Simple audio program to code and teach Polish alphabet.

## Realease issues:

The code uses `getch` library:
 - it may not work under Windows 10+; consider using msvcrt as an alternative
 - for Linux/Raspberry Pi: Tony Python has problems running getch() in command terminal, so use VisualCode instead.
